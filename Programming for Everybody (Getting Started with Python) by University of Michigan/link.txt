computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one

in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all 
but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer 
experience should be able to master the materials in this 
course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook 
“Python for Everybody”.  Once a student completes this course, 
they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses.
