The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data 
has been around since ancient times. The ancient 
Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency 
in tax collection and they accurately predicted the 
flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, 
people working in data science have carved out a 
unique and distinct field for the work they do. 
This field is data science. In this course, we 
will meet some data science practitioners and 
we will get an overview of what data science is today.
