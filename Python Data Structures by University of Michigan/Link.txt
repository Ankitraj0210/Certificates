This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python 
programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural 
programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data 
structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform 
increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the 
textbook “Python for Everybody”.  This course covers Python 3.
