About this Course

Taught by: Ian Harris
University of California, Irvine

The explosive growth of the “Internet of Things” is changing our 
world and the rapid drop in price for typical IoT components is 
allowing people to innovate new designs and products at home. In 
this first class in the specialization you will learn the importance 
of IoT in society, the current components of typical IoT devices and 
trends for the future. IoT design considerations, constraints and 
interfacing between the physical world and your device will also be covered. 
You will also learn how to make design trade-offs between hardware and software. 
We'll also cover key components of networking to ensure that students understand 
how to connect their device to the Internet.
