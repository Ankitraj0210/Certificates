Welcome to the Coursera course, Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) brought to you by the Google Cloud
team. I’m Catherine Gamboa and I’m going to be your guide.

This course covers the entire Industrial IoT network architecture
from sensors and devices to analysis. The course discusses sensors and 
devices but the focus is on the cloud side.  You'll learn about the importance 
of scaling, device communication, and processing streaming data. The course uses 
simulated devices in the labs to allow you to concentrate on learning the cloud side of IIoT.  
The course is a little different than most Coursera courses because there is very little video. 
Most of the learning is done with short readings, quizzes, and labs.
